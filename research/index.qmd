This paper provides the first causal evidence that mental health treatment facilities reduce mortality. Using within-county variation in facility availability from 1999 to 2016, I find that a 10% increase in facilities reduces mental and behavioral disorder mortality by 2%. Employing Sun and Abraham (2021) heterogeneity-robust estimators, I document three key findings: (1) facility closures cause 10 times larger mortality increases than openings provide benefits, revealing significant market asymmetries; (2) Medicaid expansion amplifies the mortality-reducing effects of facilities by 26%, demonstrating insurance-infrastructure complementarities; and (3) facilities operate through multiple mechanisms including employment creation, disability benefit access, and prescription availability. Effects are strongest among the elderly and less-educated populations. The results indicate that expanding mental health infrastructure, particularly when combined with insurance coverage, represents an effective strategy for addressing the mental health crisis. With mental health conditions costing 4% of global GDP annually, these findings have important implications for healthcare policy.
