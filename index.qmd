<div style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://aysps.gsu.edu/economics/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/) on the 2025-2026 job market. I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in **Health, Public, Labor, and Development Economics**. My research examines how access to healthcare infrastructure affects population health, with a focus on access to mental health treatment facilities (JMP), emergency medical services, and maternal healthcare. I combine cutting-edge causal inference methods with novel data from the United States and Nigeria to provide the first causal evidence on these critical policy questions. 

I am also a research assistant at the [Center on Health and Homelessness](https://chh.gsu.edu/) in the [School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/), working on the **Program and Process Evaluation's Evidence Gap Map Project**. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Centre for Econometric and Allied Research (CEAR)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/centre-for-econometrics-and-applied-research/posts/?feedView=all) at the University of Ibadan, where I developed expertise in development economics and healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here is my [CV](cv/cv.pdf), and you can reach out to me at [oyusuff4@student.gsu.edu](mailto:oyusuff4@student.gsu.edu).
