    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nCurriculum Vitae | Job Market Paper | Research | Teaching\n\nWelcome! I am a Ph.D.¬†candidate in Economics at Georgia State University on the 2025-2026 job market. I am a applied microeconomist with research interest in Health, Public, Labor, and Development Economics. My research examines how access to healthcare infrastructure affects population health, with a focus on access to mental health treatment facilities (JMP), emergency medical services, and maternal healthcare. I combine cutting-edge causal inference methods with novel data from the United States and Nigeria to provide the first causal evidence on these critical policy questions.\nI am also a research assistant at the Center on Health and Homelessness in the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, working on the Program and Process Evaluation‚Äôs Evidence Gap Map Project. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the Centre for Econometric and Allied Research (CEAR) at the University of Ibadan, where I developed expertise in development economics and healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here is my CV\n\nRecent Highlights:\n\nRecipient of the GSU Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk (CEAR) Fellowship (2025-2026)\nSelected for the Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) Professional Development Training, University of Wisconsin-Madison (2025-2026)\nListed on the AEA CSMGEP Minority Job Market Candidates 2025-26"

    "text": "Mental Healthcare Facilities and Mortality: Evidence from Local Access and Insurance Expansion\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\n\nThis paper provides the first causal evidence that mental health treatment facilities reduce mortality. Using within-county variation in facility availability from 1999 to 2016, I find that a 10% increase in facilities reduces mental and behavioral disorder mortality by 2%. Employing Sun and Abraham (2021) heterogeneity-robust estimators, I document three key findings: (1) facility closures cause 10 times larger mortality increases than openings provide benefits, revealing significant market asymmetries; (2) Medicaid expansion amplifies the mortality-reducing effects of facilities by 26%, demonstrating insurance-infrastructure complementarities; and (3) facilities operate through multiple mechanisms including employment creation, disability benefit access, and prescription availability. Effects are strongest among the elderly and less-educated populations. The results indicate that expanding mental health infrastructure, particularly when combined with insurance coverage, represents an effective strategy for addressing the mental health crisis. With mental health conditions costing 4% of global GDP annually, these findings have important implications for healthcare policy."

My teaching approach centers on three principles: accessibility through relevance, active engagement through collaboration, and empowerment through mentorship. I connect economic concepts to students‚Äô lived experiences, making abstract theories tangible through local examples and real-world applications. Having taught primarily first-generation and working students at Georgia State University, I‚Äôve learned that students excel when they see themselves reflected in the material and when multiple pathways to success are provided."
