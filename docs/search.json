    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nCurriculum Vitae | Job Market Paper | Research | Teaching\n\nWelcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Georgia State University on the 2025-2026 job market. I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in Health, Public, Labor, and Development Economics. My research examines how access to healthcare infrastructure affects population health, with a focus on access to mental health treatment facilities (JMP), emergency medical services, and maternal healthcare. I combine cutting-edge causal inference methods with novel data from the United States and Nigeria to provide the first causal evidence on these critical policy questions.\nI am also a research assistant at the Center on Health and Homelessness in the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, working on the Program and Process Evaluation’s Evidence Gap Map Project. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the Centre for Econometric and Allied Research (CEAR) at the University of Ibadan, where I developed expertise in development economics and healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here is my CV, and you can reach out to me at oyusuff4@student.gsu.edu.\n\nRecent Highlights:\n\nRecipient of the Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk (CEAR): Dissertation Fellowship & CEAR Scholar, Robinson College of Business, GSU (2025-2026)\nSelected for the Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) Professional Development Training, University of Wisconsin-Madison (2025-2026)\nRecipient of Association for Public Policy & Management Equity & Inclusion Fellowship (2025)\nRecipient of the Association for Mentoring & Inclusion in Economics Fellowship (2025)\nListed on the AEA CSMGEP Minority Job Market Candidates 2025-26"

    "text": "Mental Healthcare Facilities and Mortality: Evidence from Local Access and Insurance Expansion\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\n\nDo mental health treatment facilities save lives? Using County Business Patterns data (1999-2016) and within-county variation, I provide the first causal evidence that mental health infrastructure reduces mortality broadly. Each additional facility prevents 1.56 deaths per 100,000 residents from all causes annually, with mental and behavioral disorder (MBD) mortality declining by 0.079%. A 10% increase in facilities lowers overall mortality by 0.5% and MBD mortality by 2%. Three key findings emerge: (1) facility closures increase mortality ten times more than openings reduce it, revealing asymmetries with welfare implications; (2) Medicaid expansion amplifies facility effectiveness by 26% in high-uninsurance counties, demonstrating that insurance and infrastructure are complements, not substitutes; (3) facilities operate through multiple mechanisms beyond direct treatment, serving as gateways to disability programs and enabling pharmaceutical access. Effects concentrate among elderly and less-educated populations who face the highest access barriers. Event studies using the Sun and Abraham (2021) estimator show immediate, persistent effects with no pre-trends. The benefit-cost ratio exceeds 4-to-1, with each facility generating $11.7 million in annual net benefits. Results indicate that neither insurance expansion nor infrastructure investment alone maximizes health benefits; coordinated policies addressing both dimensions are essential for reducing mortality."

My experience spans core courses (Principles through Advanced Microeconomics) and specialized fields aligned with my research (Health, Public, and Urban Economics). I am developing innovative courses including “Economics of Health Disparities” and “Applied Economic Analysis for Policy” that bridge rigorous methods with real-world applications. Having taught 75% first-generation students with a 4.6/5.0 rating, I excel at maintaining high standards while providing multiple pathways to success."

My teaching approach centers on three principles: accessibility through relevance, active engagement through collaboration, and empowerment through mentorship. I connect economic concepts to students’ lived experiences, making abstract theories tangible through local examples and real-world applications. Having taught primarily first-generation and working students at Georgia State University, I’ve learned that students excel when they see themselves reflected in the material and when multiple pathways to success are provided."
