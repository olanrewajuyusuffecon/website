<summary>More about my teaching approach</summary>

<div style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">

I specialize in making complex economic concepts accessible to diverse student populations, particularly first-generation and working students. My experience spans core courses (Principles through Advanced Microeconomics) and specialized fields aligned with my research (Health, Public, and Urban Economics). I am developing innovative courses including "Economics of Health Disparities" and "Applied Economic Analysis for Policy" that bridge rigorous methods with real-world applications. Having taught 75% first-generation students with a 4.6/5.0 rating, I excel at maintaining high standards while providing multiple pathways to success.

## <strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong>

<details>
<summary>More about my teaching philosophy</summary>

<div style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify;">

As a first-generation college student, I understand the transformative power of accessible and engaging education. My teaching approach centers on three principles: **accessibility through relevance**, **active engagement through collaboration**, and **empowerment through mentorship**. I connect economic concepts to students' lived experiences, making abstract theories tangible through local examples and real-world applications. Having taught primarily first-generation and working students at Georgia State University, I've learned that students excel when they see themselves reflected in the material and when multiple pathways to success are provided.
